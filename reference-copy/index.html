    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log('age age2', age, age2);

    age = 200;
    console.log('age age2', age, age2);

    let name = 'mau'
    let name2 = name;
    console.log('name name2', name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log('players, team', players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'lux';
    console.log('players, team', players, team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log('team2', team2);
    team2[3] = 'mauricio';
    console.log('players, team2', players, team2);


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log('team3', team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
     const team4 = [...players]
     console.log(team4);
     team4[3] = 'armando';
     console.log('players, team4', players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);
    team5[3] = 'luiza'
    console.log('players, team5', players, team5);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    captain.age = 5;
    console.log('person, captain', person, captain); //modified original obj

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12, number: 10});
    console.log('person, captain2', person, captain2); //does not modify, but ONLY ONE LEVEL DEEP

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //ECMAscript 2018 - object literal spread operator
    const cap3 = {...person}
    console.log('cap3', cap3)

    //Poor's man deep cloning - with performance issues:


    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    console.log('person, dev2', person, dev2)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
